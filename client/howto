Validation-messages:
 - adding <div data-role="validation-msg"></div> into the context enables to work with
   the BaseView's removeValidation and showAsValidation methods.
 - The context-argument, if given, makes this method working relative to the given dom-context.
   For instance, when the above div is contained in a context container. 
   
 Error-handling:
 - Distinguishes between Validation/Config Errors and unexpected errors.
 - Both is handled in BaseController.handleError.
   This invokes the BaseViews showAsValidation resp showAsError methods.
 - the context-argument works as above, only for unexpected errors it has no effect
   because it always is shown in pop-up.
